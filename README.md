Hello my name is John and I'm wondering how much content I need to write for it to force me to move to another line. Like can this thing handle paragraphs - ok this answered my own question.

  This is really important stuff! </body>
  
 Wow that was amazing HTML. I'm a programming genius. Why do i like to type so much and come up with stories and overall familiarity with how computers work? Should I be working as an author? I literally love the idea of writing a whole bunch of text is one of my favorite things to do. Like writing an opinion piece or blog post? I would literally be able to write from like sunup to sundown. I think. Maybe this would get old when my fingers get tired. But I guess for that I have talk to text?That tech is getting a lot better (think dragon dictation) to where I could potentially use it to write stuff! Do blogs even make money or is it where content creation dreams go to die? I guess the world will never know. Unless I do it. I mean why not I would probably learn a bit about how all of this stuff works.
 ok well that's what I had to say. Cool to see the numbers only change based off of times I press "enter".
print = "that".
type = blah
